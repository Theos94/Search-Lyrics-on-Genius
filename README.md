Search-Lyrics-on-Genius

Simple extension that recognizes if you're on a youtube/watch page, then it can be clicked.

On click it will grab the title of the video you're watching it and open in a new page a genius.com page
with the Title as Search.

It just saves a few clicks and some typing.

Also if you type in any tab slg and then hit tab or space it will recognize the command
and begin listening for your input. Anything you type after will be used as input to Search on genius.com

This is still not on Chrome Web Store, im gonna see and put it up there in a few days.

To use this, either clone or download the zip, extract somewhere on your PC, then go into Chrome and go into chrome://extensions
and tick Developer Mode in the right upper corner. After that click on "Load Unpacked" and just navigate to the folder containing
the Search Lyrics. Then just enable it and it should be working.
